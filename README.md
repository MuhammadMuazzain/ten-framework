# Bulgarian AI Voice Agent
==========================

About
-----

I built this Bulgarian AI voice agent as a personal project to demonstrate my skills in developing conversational AI systems. This project showcases my ability to design, develop, and deploy an AI voice agent that can understand, speak, and respond in Bulgarian with high accuracy and human-like voice quality.

## Features

* Develops an AI voice agent that understands and speaks Bulgarian fluently
* Supports both RTC and WebSocket connections for real-time interactions
* Extends the agent with memory to store user preferences and context
* Includes a demo to evaluate the overall performance, language fluency, and conversational logic of the system

## Technical Details

* Built using [TEN Framework] (https://github.com/ten-framework/ten_framework) for real-time multimodal conversational AI
* Utilizes [VAD] (https://github.com/ten-vad/ten_vad) for voice activity detection and [Turn Detection] (https://github.com/ten-turn-detection/ten_turn_detection) for conversation flow management

## Setup and Installation

To run the demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/bulgarian-ai-voice-agent.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the demo: `node index.js`

## Running the Demo

To run the demo, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:
```bash
node index.js
```
This will start the voice agent and make it available at `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with the agent using a web browser or a WebSocket client.
